# Power Platform Process (Flow) App

A Power Platform solution consisting of multiple cloud flows and a canvas app. The app enables users to define their own processes, each with customizable triggers and actions. It integrates with a PDF-splitting function so that when physical documents are scanned, the resulting PDFs are automatically split‚Äîand each split PDF initiates a separate process.

The service principal needs to be created before continuing with this step.
To give permissions to sites.selected, we have 2 options. Choose one that works best for you.

#### Option 1: Graph Explorer

```http
GET | https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites?select=webUrl,Title,Id&$search="<Name of the site>*"
POST | https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<SiteId from above>/permissions
{
    "roles": [
        "write"
    ],
    "grantedToIdentities": [
        {
            "application": {
                "id": "<Client ID App Registration>",
                "displayName": "<A display name the app, only used to identify>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Option 2: MS Graph PowerShell

```powershell
Search-MgSite -Search '"<Name of the site>*"' | Select-Object WebUrl, DisplayName, Id

$siteId = "<SiteId>"
$body = @{
    roles = @("write")
    grantedToIdentities = @(
        @{
            application = @{
                id: "<Client ID App Registration>",
                displayName: "<A display name the app, only used to identify>"
            }
        }
    )
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

2. Set all connections and variables (if first time deployment. This step isn't necessary if the solution has already been deployed before and no new connections/variables have been added)

#### Connectors

Log in with all the prompted connectors. Make sure to login with a service principal if the connection name is called "Service Principal", or with the service account if it's called "Service Account". If it's called "User Account", you may login with your personal account.
